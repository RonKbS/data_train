#### 11th - 16th November 2019

As of last week, I was only able to go through a few of the pandas examples to become familiar with the various pandas methods available.
I had a hackathon over the weekend that needed time to prepare for. Also had a new job I was beginnning on Friday.
PS: We came in third in that [hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/wics-wildlife-intelligent-crime-scanner)
